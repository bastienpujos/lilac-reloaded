From version 2.0.1 on its possible to upgrade a lilac-reloaded installation.

Just copy over all new files in lilac-reloaded (except includes/lilac-conf.php) and run update.php in your browser.
Follow the steps and you have a shiny new updated lilac-reloaded.

Lilac-reloaded will also autodetect if a upgrade is needed and will forward you to the update.php site.
